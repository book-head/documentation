# Collections and staff picks

Bookhead lets you create curated collections of books to feature on your website and sales channels. Collections are perfect for highlighting staff recommendations, seasonal themes, or any grouping you want to showcase.

## Collections

Collections are curated lists of specific books from your inventory. Use them for:

- **Themed displays**: "Summer Reading", "Holiday Gift Guide", "Local Authors"
- **Marketing campaigns**: Books for a newsletter, social media feature, or in-store display
- **Website navigation**: Featured sections on your storefront

### Creating a collection

1. Go to **Collections** in the staff menu
2. Click **Create collection**
3. Enter a name for your collection (e.g., "Summer Reading 2024")
4. Search for books to add using ISBN or title
5. Click **Add** to include books in the collection
6. Click **Save**

### Managing collections

From the collections list, you can:

- **View** the books in each collection
- **Edit** to add or remove books
- **Delete** collections you no longer need

### How collections sync to channels

Collections sync to **Shopify** as Custom Collections. When you create or update a collection in Bookhead, it automatically syncs to your Shopify store within 15 minutes.

**Note:** Squarespace doesn't support collections via API. For Squarespace, use [categories](/docs/channels#managing-product-categories) instead.

## Staff picks

Staff picks are a special type of collection that highlights books recommended by your team. They're a great way to add a personal touch to your online store.

### How staff picks work

Staff picks are connected to **reviews**. When a staff member writes a review for a book:

1. The book is automatically added to that staff member's "Staff Picks" collection
2. The collection is named after the reviewer (e.g., "Margaret's Picks")
3. The collection syncs to your sales channels

### Creating a staff pick

1. Go to **Staff Picks** in the staff menu
2. Click **New review**
3. Search for the book you want to recommend
4. Write your review
5. Click **Save**

The book is now in your staff picks collection and will sync to connected channels.

### Managing staff picks

From the staff picks page, you can:

- **View** all reviews and their associated books
- **Edit** existing reviews
- **Delete** reviews (removes the book from staff picks)

### Displaying staff picks

Staff picks collections work like regular collections - they sync to Shopify as Custom Collections. You can feature them on your website's homepage, navigation, or anywhere you display collections.

## Collections vs. categories

It's easy to confuse collections and categories. Here's the difference:

| | Collections | Categories |
|--|-------------|------------|
| **What they are** | Curated lists of specific books | Organizational groupings based on genre/type |
| **How they're created** | You manually add books | Books are automatically included based on their point-of-sale category code |
| **Use case** | "Staff Picks", "Holiday Gifts" | "Fiction", "History", "Children's Books" |
| **Syncs to** | Shopify (as Custom Collections) | Shopify and Squarespace (as tags/categories) |

**Use collections** when you want to hand-pick specific books.
**Use categories** when you want to organize books by genre or type.
