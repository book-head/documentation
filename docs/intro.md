# Overview

Bookhead helps your independent bookstore sell books online. We automatically sync your inventory to multiple sales channels - your point-of-sale system stays the source of truth, and Bookhead keeps everything else in sync.

## What we integrate with

**Point-of-sale systems** (inventory source):
- Booklog - automatic sync every 30 minutes
- IBID - automatic sync every hour
- Basil - manual file upload

**Sales channels** (where you sell):
- Squarespace - full product sync with inventory updates
- Shopify - full product sync with collections support
- eBay - marketplace listings
- Biblio - used book marketplace

## How it works

1. **Your point-of-sale syncs to Bookhead** - automatically via FTP or manual file upload
2. **Bookhead enriches your data** with cover images, descriptions, and bibliographic metadata
3. **Products sync to your channels** automatically - Squarespace, Shopify, eBay, Biblio
4. **When books sell**, your point-of-sale updates, and Bookhead syncs the change everywhere

You manage your inventory in your point-of-sale. Bookhead handles everything else.
