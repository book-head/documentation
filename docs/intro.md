# Overview
Bookhead helps independent bookstores sell their books online. We do that with two products: Bookhead Connect and Bookhead Complete.

## Bookhead Connect

Bookhead Connect automatically syncs your bookstore inventory to multiple sales channels. We currently support listing your products on Squarespace, Biblio, and eBay. We can sync the local store inventory from your point of sales provider if they support inventory syncing with third parties. Currently we're able to sync with Basil and plan to integrate with other point of sales as we're able.

If you are interested in using Bookhead but we don't yet support your point of sales, please email sam@bookhead.net and we can work together with your point of sales provider to integrate automatic syncing.

## Bookhead Complete

Bookhead Complete includes a custom e-commerce store in addition to all of the inventory syncing and other features of Bookhead Connect. You can sell your products on an e-commerce website with custom content, with a custom domain for your store.
